# WCNegentropy

> Open-source developer tools, AI research, and regenerative agriculture ventures.

## About

WCNegentropy is a Delaware holdco building across open-source developer tools, experimental AI research, and regenerative agriculture. We ship MIT-licensed software, publish novel model architectures on HuggingFace, and are bootstrapping a regenerative ag pilot in New Jersey.
